# Test
To test this, first enter your mysql credentials, then run SOURCE db/schema.sql. Next you will quit from mysql databse, and enter onto terminal npm run seed, which will populate the databse with the existing data. Afterwards you will run on terminal npm start to start server, and then proceed to insomia.
